# OfficeBuildingREIDDataset
REID dataset used in [1]:

> The OfficeBuilding dataset contains two camera views (an outdoor and indoor view) of people entering and leaving a building during a single workday. Images from the outdoor camera are used for the gallery and the within-camera query. To ensure the within-camera query and the gallery do not have frames of an individual from the same time, we take all frames from a person entering the building for the first time (typically early morning) as the within-camera query image. People exiting the building and anyone seen re-entering the building on the outdoor camera are used as part of the gallery. All individuals seen in the indoor camera view are used for the across-camera view query image. Figure 3 shows sample images from the OfficeBuilding dataset.
